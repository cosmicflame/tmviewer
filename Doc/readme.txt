  This useful freeware application allows you to view maps generated by Tibia game client. Visit http://www.tibia.org to learn more about Tibia.

  Make sure that your desktop color depth is set to High-color or True-color to get the best visual quality.

Usage:
------

Start the application.
If current folder contains no Tibia maps, you will be prompted to select folder where Tibia client is installed. You can select maps folder at any time by choosing 'File/Open' menu to open folder selection dialog.
After correct folder has been chosen, you will see ground level of the Tibia map. Change Zoom, Level, scroll the map by mouse-dragging or using scrollbars and Enjoy.

Drawing modes overview:
-----------------------

Overlay mode:

  When Overlay mode is active, upper and lower levels of the map are drawn over the shaded ground level. This mode allows you to see where any place is located relative to the ground level of the map. You can increase/decrease intensity of the shaded levels using slider on the toolbar or using Ctrl-NumPad+ and Ctrl-NumPad- keys.

Filtered drawing mode:

  This mode is applied only when zoom ratio less than 100%. When Filtered drawing mode is active, the map data is approximated, resulting much better image quality than normal mode. However, approximation is CPU intensive task, thus it slows down map drawing. 
  NOTE: Filtered drawing mode is not supported by Windows 95/98.

Map symbols editor
------------------

  You can create and edit map symbols. There are 2 types of map symbols:
1. Text label - represents text label over map at specified location.
2. Mark       - represents graphical mark with name and detailed description.
